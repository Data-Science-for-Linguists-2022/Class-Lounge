## Rohan's Notes

Something I liked - I thought it was very interesting how you're looking to study the language learners' syntactic proficiency.
That seems to be a more ambitious analysis goal, especially when I think about what we've done in class with esl learners.

Something to improve - There was a good amount of description and analysis, but it was generally quite terse and technical. I
wasn't entirely sure what some of the measurements you mentioned were, and you didn't go into detail about them. I would have
liked a little more description and consideration of your audience's knowledge level in the analysis.

Something I learned - Your data set was really interesting! I thought it was fascinating how uneven the language counts were
compared to the ETS data we've worked with as a class.

## Kinan's Notes

Something I liked - The data sample was cool to see because it puts into perspective how you are going to move forward with this and what you're going to be analyzing from your project plan.

Something to improve - The readme could be a bit more organized. Maybe describe each file?

Something I learned -The history plot with seaborn was really cool to see
