## Rohan's Notes

Something I liked - I thought it was very interesting how you're looking to study the language learners' syntactic proficiency.
That seems to be a more ambitious analysis goal, especially when I think about what we've done in class with esl learners.

Something to improve - There was a good amount of description and analysis, but it was generally quite terse and technical. I
wasn't entirely sure what some of the measurements you mentioned were, and you didn't go into detail about them. I would have
liked a little more description and consideration of your audience's knowledge level in the analysis.

Something I learned - Your data set was really interesting! I thought it was fascinating how uneven the language counts were
compared to the ETS data we've worked with as a class.

## Misha's Feedback

**One thing that was done well:** I really like your visuals and I'm glad to see that you have an idea of how to operationalize syntactic complexity

**One avenue for improvement or suggestion:** You might want to include a little bit of info about how these measures of syntactic complexity can be found and quantified in/from the data

**One thing I learned:** PELIC has POS tagging, that rocks!

## Kinan's Notes

Something I liked - The data sample was cool to see because it puts into perspective how you are going to move forward with this and what you're going to be analyzing from your project plan.

Something to improve - The readme could be a bit more organized. Maybe describe each file?

Something I learned -The history plot with seaborn was really cool to see

## Man Ho's Notes

Something I liked - The topic is very interesting. I wonder how much a learner's English syntax reflects the learner's L1. The difference in syntax among learners of different L1s may be very subtle, particularly if you are comparing learners of the same English proficiency/ level. It is a good idea to look at many metrics at the same time.

Something to improve - I think you can include the definitions of different labels in your data. For example, what are the 'level_id's? How are they related to proficiency level A1 to C2? Besides, the dataset has an unequal distribution of L1s. This will likely affect the accuracy of your predictive analysis, if that's what you plan to do with the data. You may need to figure out how to overcome this class imbalance problem.

Something I learned - TAASCC is a very convenient tool to measure multiply linguistic metrics simultaneously!
