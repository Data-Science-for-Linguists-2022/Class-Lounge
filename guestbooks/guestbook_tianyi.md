## Rohan's Notes

Something I liked - I thought it was very interesting how you're looking to study the language learners' syntactic proficiency.
That seems to be a more ambitious analysis goal, especially when I think about what we've done in class with esl learners.

Something to improve - There was a good amount of description and analysis, but it was generally quite terse and technical. I
wasn't entirely sure what some of the measurements you mentioned were, and you didn't go into detail about them. I would have
liked a little more description and consideration of your audience's knowledge level in the analysis.

Something I learned - Your data set was really interesting! I thought it was fascinating how uneven the language counts were 
compared to the ETS data we've worked with as a class.
