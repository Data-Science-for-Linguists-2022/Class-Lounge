## Caroline's entry (2022-03-17)

I think we're all finding each other's projects to be super interesting, but I will reiterate and say that this is a very interesting project! I'm looking forward to seeing what you find out from a data-driven analysis as opposed to simply a human reading through the lyrics / knowing about the artists and doing more of a informal, qualitative analysis.

- **What was done well:** This is a rather small detail, but one that makes your project repo / project in general much more approachable upon first encounter - I like that you have updated your *README.md* to include a brief project summary. I haven't gotten around to doing this yet, but it's a reminder that I need to! Additionally, the commentary and explanations that accompany your code are well done. I like that when I am looking at your code and the output, I can follow your thought process from when you yourself were encountering the output.

- **Possible improvements:** Small thing to "improve" - the link to *load_json_to_df.ipynb* in your *progress_report.md* is broken. Just letting you know so you can go back and see what's up!

- **One thing I learned:** I didn't realize there was a package to go along with lyrics from Genius. I'm always surprised and fascinated to find out that if you want to do something, someone has probably already created a tool for you to do so! Super cool.

## Ben's Notes
As a fan of outsider music, I really love your project idea!
I think you have a very clear research question and data acquisition strategy.
I liked how you acknowledged potential problems with the data, like the high number of songs
by Wesley Willis, which could skew the data.
One possible improvement could be to pick a license, as the project currently has an empty `LICENSE.md` file.
