## Kinan's Feedback
Taking a look at your project plan it is very easy to follow, the links to things that you explain in it are very helpful and leave me with little to no questions about your goals and where you are headed with your project, that is something I am going to steal from you and put into mine. In your Jupyter notebook file, everthing is very well organized and explained. I like how you use markdowns to explain each datatype and what you intend to do with it. Again, it left me with little to no questions about what each part of your project is doing. One thing I would reccomend is making a table of contents and clear sections in your code so that it is easy to follow the plan and your progress without having to scroll through every output.
