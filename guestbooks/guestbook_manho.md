Hello! Welcome to my guestbook.

## Kinan's Feedback
Taking a look at your project plan it is very easy to follow, the links to things that you explain in it are very helpful and leave me with little to no questions about your goals and where you are headed with your project, that is something I am going to steal from you and put into mine. In your Jupyter notebook file, everthing is very well organized and explained. I like how you use markdowns to explain each datatype and what you intend to do with it. Again, it left me with little to no questions about what each part of your project is doing. One thing I would reccomend is making a table of contents and clear sections in your code so that it is easy to follow the plan and your progress without having to scroll through every output.

> @Kinan: Thanks! I am happy that the project plan and JNBs are easy to follow! I like your idea to make a table of contents in the JNBs. I will add a table of contents to each of those JNBs when I am done with testing and editing. (Mar 22, 2022)

- **What was done well:** I really liked the schedule table in the project plan.  It made the project a bit more tangible than having just plan explanation alone. The jupyter notebooks were definitely formatted for comprehension and reproducibility--right off the bat, you're explaining how the same code can be run on someone else's machine.
- **What could be improved:** The README could definitely be expanded upon, since it's the first page visitors will see.  I felt a bit intimidated by the large chunks of explanation in the project plan and progress report, and the README would be a great opportunity to create a more succinct version of these documents with just the basic details needed to understand the goals of the project and the files in the repository.
- **What I learned:** It's super interesting to see the structure of this corpus--it's very different from what we've looked at in class and from the data I've seen in my project.  I'm not familiar with .CHAT files, so seeing the metadata analysis with CHAT tools was very cool.

> @Emma: Thanks! I think the schedule table helps me track my progress easier. I have updated the README.md file of the repo and I will add more info later. I hope this will help you navigate the repo. (Mar 22, 2022)

## Caroline's entry (2022-03-22)

- **What was done well:** Your visualizations are always so well done. They are all well laid out and informative. The timeline you included in your *project_plan.md* was also a cool feature. Hopefully you've been able to stay on track with what you initially intended to do!

- **Possible improvements:** Since some of your notebooks are long but are already broken up nicely with appropriate headers, it may be beneficial to add a table of contents at the beginning of them so that each of the sections are more easily accessible.

- **One thing I learned:** I overall just learned more about `pylangacq`. I, too, am using CHILDES CHAT data for my secondary dataset and have begun working through the dataset with the basic features of `pylangacq`, but I haven't utilized everything I want to yet, so it was nice to see someone who has used it!

## Ben's feedback
I thought your project plan and readme were very well organized.
I liked how you had a file going over `pylangacq` and its functions,
and thought your plots were well made. I definitely learned a few things about plotting I didn't know before.
One improvement, like Caroline said, could be adding links to each section at the top of the notebook - especially
since the sections are so well thought out.


## Alejandro's Feedback
This is an extremely interesting project and it never occurred to me how in-depth and important childhood linguistical study can be. Something I liked was just how detailed you are with explaining the layout and purposes of your repository in the `README.md` (something I wish more people took the time to do). Something I wish was improved however, would be explaining all the various metrics used in your analysis, as I was very confused reading them and didn't really know what they meant or why they were important. Something I learned is, once again, how to better use `pyplot()` and graphing in Python, which is something I feel like I struggle with a lot. Your graphs are extremely nice and I wish I understood `matplotlib` better.
