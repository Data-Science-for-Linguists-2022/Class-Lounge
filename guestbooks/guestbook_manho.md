Hello! Welcome to my guestbook.

## Kinan's Feedback
Taking a look at your project plan it is very easy to follow, the links to things that you explain in it are very helpful and leave me with little to no questions about your goals and where you are headed with your project, that is something I am going to steal from you and put into mine. In your Jupyter notebook file, everthing is very well organized and explained. I like how you use markdowns to explain each datatype and what you intend to do with it. Again, it left me with little to no questions about what each part of your project is doing. One thing I would reccomend is making a table of contents and clear sections in your code so that it is easy to follow the plan and your progress without having to scroll through every output.

> @Kinan: Thanks! I am happy that the project plan and JNBs are easy to follow! I like your idea to make a table of contents in the JNBs. I will add a table of contents to each of those JNBs when I am done with testing and editing.

- **What was done well:** I really liked the schedule table in the project plan.  It made the project a bit more tangible than having just plan explanation alone. The jupyter notebooks were definitely formatted for comprehension and reproducibility--right off the bat, you're explaining how the same code can be run on someone else's machine.
- **What could be improved:** The README could definitely be expanded upon, since it's the first page visitors will see.  I felt a bit intimidated by the large chunks of explanation in the project plan and progress report, and the README would be a great opportunity to create a more succinct version of these documents with just the basic details needed to understand the goals of the project and the files in the repository.
- **What I learned:** It's super interesting to see the structure of this corpus--it's very different from what we've looked at in class and from the data I've seen in my project.  I'm not familiar with .CHAT files, so seeing the metadata analysis with CHAT tools was very cool.

> @Emma: Thanks! I think the schedule table helps me track my progress easier. I have updated the README.md file of the repo and I will add more info later. I hope this will help you navigate the repo.
