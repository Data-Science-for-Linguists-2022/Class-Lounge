Hi Misha! I looked at your project and I am slighly lost a little. I know how you feel about getting lost in the data, my project is also giving me a really hard time with getting everything. Where the code didnt explain, your project plan did so thats really good. I like how its one of your goals to encode Cyrillic. I also like how you chose to go with Russian, the  thing i remember about when we first met was how interested you were in Russian langauge so I'm really excited to see the work you do with this. I would reccomend combining the two progress reports, unless its written somewhere that we shouldn't.

**One thing that was done well:** Getting the data and the permission for fair use

**One avenue for improvement or suggestion:** The error you got was probably caused by encoding error. You may try opening the file with "encoding specified". For example:  
`file = open(filename, encoding="utf8")`

You may need to check the type of encoding your file has.

**One thing I learned:** Reading and parsing non-latin letters are not straightforward...
