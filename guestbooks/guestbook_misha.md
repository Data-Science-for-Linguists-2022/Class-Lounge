Hi Misha! I looked at your project and I am slighly lost a little. I know how you feel about getting lost in the data, my project is also giving me a really hard time with getting everything. Where the code didnt explain, your project plan did so thats really good. I like how its one of your goals to encode Cyrillic. I also like how you chose to go with Russian, the  thing i remember about when we first met was how interested you were in Russian langauge so I'm really excited to see the work you do with this. I would reccomend combining the two progress reports, unless its written somewhere that we shouldn't.
