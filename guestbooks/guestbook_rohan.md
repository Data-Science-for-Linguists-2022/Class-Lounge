## Man Ho's Feedback

**One thing that was done well:** Good choice of clean data source

**One avenue for improvement or suggestion:** Perhaps explain a bit more about the choice of data structure used in your project. Since you will work on a large volume of data, I think you will need to deal with problems related to memory efficiency.

**One thing I learned:** Using BeautifulSoup for webscraping

## Kinan's Feedback

**One thing that was done well:** Your project plan is very easy to follow.

**One avenue for improvement or suggestion:** Maybe make sections in the progress report of each "task" or like "portion" of work so that we can see overtime how much you focused on specific tasks.

**One thing I learned:** There is a lot of fanfaction out there with a bunch of varying genres. Also the webscraping is really cool.
