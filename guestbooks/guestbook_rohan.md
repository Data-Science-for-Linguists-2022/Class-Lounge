## Misha's Feedback

**One thing that was done well:** Your tag parsing BeautifulSoup function is incredibly impressive. It's easy to follow code-wise and the meta-data that you've gotten out of it is fantastic

**One avenue for improvement or suggestion:** I'd be really interested to know what kinds of hypotheses you might have about your classifier. I think it'll have a pretty easy time classifying by relationship, and fandom goes without saying. You might want to look into rating and see how it does, that could be useful for AO3 users, they could use your classifier as a fun little way of suggesting a rating before publishing.

**One thing I learned:** I'm really interested in this BeautifulSoup parser and maybe looking into html/metadata parsing in the future!

## Man Ho's Feedback

**One thing that was done well:** Good choice of clean data source

**One avenue for improvement or suggestion:** Perhaps explain a bit more about the choice of data structure used in your project. Since you will work on a large volume of data, I think you will need to deal with problems related to memory efficiency.

**One thing I learned:** Using BeautifulSoup for webscraping


**Rohan's response:** Thank you so much for commenting! I'll go through and add more detail about several things when I'm cleaning up before I submit my second progress report.


## Kinan's Feedback

**One thing that was done well:** Your project plan is very easy to follow.

**One avenue for improvement or suggestion:** Maybe make sections in the progress report of each "task" or like "portion" of work so that we can see overtime how much you focused on specific tasks.

**One thing I learned:** There is a lot of fanfaction out there with a bunch of varying genres. Also the webscraping is really cool.

## Emma's Feedback

- **What was done well:** I really love that you described spiders.  This is a term I've seen multiple times but haven't had a real reason to learn about yet.  You also specified how they must be used, which is very helpful.  This project is super interesting and very well organized. I'm excited to see where it goes!
- **What could be improved:** Are you collecting the most recent fanfictions on the site? Only the English pages? I couldn't find this specified anywhere (at least not clearly).  I also wasn't able to find the data samples described in your progress_report -- I'm not sure if you intended to leave them unpublished for now!  You may also specify what you mean by 'genre' (or at least give a few examples of what you expect to use).
- **One thing I learned:** Very intrigued by the Fandom.value_counts() distribution... And I learned about spiders (see the "What was done well" section above)!
