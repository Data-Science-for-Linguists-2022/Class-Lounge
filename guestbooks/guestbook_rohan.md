## Misha's Feedback

**One thing that was done well:** Your tag parsing BeautifulSoup function is incredibly impressive. It's easy to follow code-wise and the meta-data that you've gotten out of it is fantastic

**One avenue for improvement or suggestion:** I'd be really interested to know what kinds of hypotheses you might have about your classifier. I think it'll have a pretty easy time classifying by relationship, and fandom goes without saying. You might want to look into rating and see how it does, that could be useful for AO3 users, they could use your classifier as a fun little way of suggesting a rating before publishing. Also check out Michael Yoder's github for his dissertation if you get the chance [Michael Yoder's dissertation](https://michaelmilleryoder.github.io/)

**One thing I learned:** I'm really interested in this BeautifulSoup parser and maybe looking into html/metadata parsing in the future!

## Man Ho's Feedback

**One thing that was done well:** Good choice of clean data source

**One avenue for improvement or suggestion:** Perhaps explain a bit more about the choice of data structure used in your project. Since you will work on a large volume of data, I think you will need to deal with problems related to memory efficiency.

**One thing I learned:** Using BeautifulSoup for webscraping


**Rohan's response:** Thank you so much for commenting! I'll go through and add more detail about several things when I'm cleaning up before I submit my second progress report.


## Kinan's Feedback

**One thing that was done well:** Your project plan is very easy to follow.

**One avenue for improvement or suggestion:** Maybe make sections in the progress report of each "task" or like "portion" of work so that we can see overtime how much you focused on specific tasks.

**One thing I learned:** There is a lot of fanfaction out there with a bunch of varying genres. Also the webscraping is really cool.

## Emma's Feedback

- **What was done well:** I really love that you described spiders.  This is a term I've seen multiple times but haven't had a real reason to learn about yet.  You also specified how they must be used, which is very helpful.  This project is super interesting and very well organized. I'm excited to see where it goes!
- **What could be improved:** Are you collecting the most recent fanfictions on the site? Only the English pages? I couldn't find this specified anywhere (at least not clearly).  I also wasn't able to find the data samples described in your progress_report -- I'm not sure if you intended to leave them unpublished for now!  You may also specify what you mean by 'genre' (or at least give a few examples of what you expect to use).
- **One thing I learned:** Very intrigued by the Fandom.value_counts() distribution... And I learned about spiders (see the "What was done well" section above)!

## Caroline's feedback (2022-04-07)

- **What was done well:** Your progress reports are very detailed, and I like that in your exploratory JNB you took stock of your DataFrame and the decisions that went into building it.

- **Possible improvements:** Since you now know more about your project and have a lot of different files, it could be nice to add to your *README.md* file so that visitors can get a general idea of what your project is without having to go through all the code.

- **One thing I learned:** This was my first time encountering spiders and BeautifulSoup! Also, it was quite interesting to see all the different information about the fan fics as a whole.

# Ben's Feedback
I thought it was very interesting how you were able to get so much data.
I liked that you showed the data frame and examined parts of it; it makes it easier to understand the project from an outside perspective.
One possible improvement could be fleshing out the README file, since it is the first impression and a good place to get a high-level overview of the project and its structure.
One thing I learned was in your data section, where you showed value counts for Rating and Category; I thought the results were interesting.

## Alejandro's Feedback
This is a really interesting project. I am surprised at the amount and varied fanfiction work you've collected. I really like how you went about collecting the data using a really robust framework. However, I see that you have trouble cleaning the data, which can be a problem for the presentation. I think you should try your best to take care of that as well as organize your `README.md` file better. I also learned that there's already over 150 _Encanto_ fanfics out there despite the movie only coming out a few months ago, which scares me.
