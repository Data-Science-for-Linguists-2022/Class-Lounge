## Background Information
I wanted to do this project because I wanted to see what sociolinguistic phenomena occur in video-game dialogue, I also just enjoy games and game design, and thought this would be a great way to combine two of my passions. I hope you all enjoy it!

## Notes:

### Rohan's Notes:

Something I liked: I love the concept, and I really liked the way you organized your data: it was really easy to get a good idea
of your data without having to wade through it myself (which would have been especially difficult since it was in pickled
format). I'm really excited to see what you find on the sociolinguistic variations between and within games.

Something to improve: I thought you were really ambitious, but I wasn't quite sure what the end goal of your project was. You
seemed to have a lot of different questions to answer, and I wasn't sure which was your main one and how feasible it was with
your dataset. A little clarity on that would be much appreciated.

Something I learned: I've played a good number of video games myself, but I've never delved into the ones you're analyzing here,
so I learned a lot about the structure of these intensive world-building games! I've never thought about how much written material
there is in your standard RPG, but I'm looking forward to seeing your analysis.
