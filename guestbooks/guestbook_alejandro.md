## Background Information
I wanted to do this project because I wanted to see what sociolinguistic phenomena occur in video-game dialogue, I also just enjoy games and game design, and thought this would be a great way to combine two of my passions. I hope you all enjoy it!

## Thanks!
I want to say thank you to everyone who visits this repository. Your feedback is very valuable to me!

## Notes:

### Tianyi's Feedback

- **What was done well:**
I think you posed very interesting research questions in what I believe to be an understudied form of media.
You were very clear about the focus of your research and took into account the contexts in which the games were developed (such as their respective genres and the sizes of their respective studios).

- **What could be improved:**
I think you could be a bit clearer about what techniques you plan to use to analyze the data.
There is *a lot* of dialogue in the games that you chose to analyze; Hollow Knight alone, for instance, has 215 pages of dialogue.
How do you plan to analyze all of that data?
Will you be writing a script to pick out certain linguistic elements, or will you be sampling from the data and analyzing them manually?
If the latter, how do you plan to select the samples?

- **One thing I learned:**
It was interesting how you parsed the dialogue for Hollow Knight using two different file formats, though you were lucky to have found a data source that was so well-formatted.
Also, your use of `IPython.display` looks like it'd be really useful for getting nicer-looking output (though I'm not sure what it's meant to do since it looks the same to me on GitHub).


### Rohan's Notes:

Something I liked: I love the concept, and I really liked the way you organized your data: it was really easy to get a good idea
of your data without having to wade through it myself (which would have been especially difficult since it was in pickled
format). I'm really excited to see what you find on the sociolinguistic variations between and within games.

Something to improve: I thought you were really ambitious, but I wasn't quite sure what the end goal of your project was. You
seemed to have a lot of different questions to answer, and I wasn't sure which was your main one and how feasible it was with
your dataset. A little clarity on that would be much appreciated.

Something I learned: I've played a good number of video games myself, but I've never delved into the ones you're analyzing here,
so I learned a lot about the structure of these intensive world-building games! I've never thought about how much written material
there is in your standard RPG, but I'm looking forward to seeing your analysis.

## Misha's Feedback

**One thing that was done well:** You have some really great coding in your project already, stuff that's way above my paygrade! Great start at considering your linguistic research questions

**One avenue for improvement or suggestion:** I'd be interested in seeing more about how you operationalize your variables for pragmatics and discourse

**One thing I learned:** I'd never thought of it that way, but it makes sense that video game dialogue is going to break gricean maxims
