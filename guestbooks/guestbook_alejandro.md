## Background Information
I wanted to do this project because I wanted to see what sociolinguistic phenomena occur in video-game dialogue, I also just enjoy games and game design, and thought this would be a great way to combine two of my passions. I hope you all enjoy it!

### Tianyi's Feedback

- **What was done well:**
I think you posed very interesting research questions in what I believe to be an understudied form of media.
You were very clear about the focus of your research and took into account the contexts in which the games were developed (such as their respective genres and the sizes of their respective studios).

- **What could be improved:**
I think you could be a bit clearer about what techniques you plan to use to analyze the data.
There is *a lot* of dialogue in the games that you chose to analyze; Hollow Knight alone, for instance, has 215 pages of dialogue.
How do you plan to analyze all of that data?
Will you be writing a script to pick out certain linguistic elements, or will you be sampling from the data and analyzing them manually?
If the latter, how do you plan to select the samples?

- **One thing I learned:**
It was interesting how you parsed the dialogue for Hollow Knight using two different file formats, though you were lucky to have found a data source that was so well-formatted.
Also, your use of `IPython.display` looks like it'd be really useful for getting nicer-looking output (though I'm not sure what it's meant to do since it looks the same to me on GitHub).
