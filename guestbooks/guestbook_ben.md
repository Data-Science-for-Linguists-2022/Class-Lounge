# [Latin Indirect Speech](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Latin-Indirect-Speech)
## Ben Miller
Hi, thank you for looking at my project!

### Alejandro's Notes:
I think this project will be very interesting and ripe for deep linguistic analysis. I don't know anything about Latin, so learning about the two ways one can communicate indirect speech is extremely interesting. I definitely see the second way's lingering presence in Romance languages as well. However, I suggest you give more examples on indirect speech or clarify what counts as direct/indirect speech since the examples you give for indirect latin speech translated differently than the example you gave in English. Maybe just state how this is indirect speech. Also, I absolutely love grammar (so I may be biased in saying this), but I think you could give a deeper explanation of how the various components of the sentence work to form indirect speech in your examples. But overall, I think you did an extremely good job on encountering data that will contribute towards your project.

### Tianyi's Feedback

- **What was done well:**
I think you did a good job processing the data.
Your code was very clean and easy to follow, and I found the bar plots to be very useful for understanding the distribution of the two constructions.

- **What could be improved:**
I think you could go into more detail about what exactly constitutes "indirect speech"; does it mean that only constructions involving words related to speech ("said", "reported", "told", "stated", etc.) will be considered?
Your project plan says that your project will include *some* complementizer phrases since the construction is the same in Latin, but is there some way in which you plan to differentiate the two?
If not, then stating as such would probably help clarify the goals of your project.
Also, how will the subjunctive mood ("It's best that he go soon", etc.) be differentiated, if at all?

- **One thing I learned:**
I hadn't known that the structure of complementizer phrases was something that had changed so drastically in Latin.
Is it known when the "quod" construction first arose in Latin texts?
I'd love to see more background info about this topic.
