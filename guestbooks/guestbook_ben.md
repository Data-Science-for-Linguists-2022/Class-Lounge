# [Latin Indirect Speech](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Latin-Indirect-Speech)
## Ben Miller
Hi, thank you for looking at my project!

### Alejandro's Notes:
I think this project will be very interesting and ripe for deep linguistic analysis. I don't know anything about Latin, so learning about the two ways one can communicate indirect speech is extremely interesting. I definitely see the second way's lingering presence in Romance languages as well. However, I suggest you give more examples on indirect speech or clarify what counts as direct/indirect speech since the examples you give for indirect latin speech translated differently than the example you gave in English. Maybe just state how this is indirect speech. Also, I absolutely love grammar (so I may be biased in saying this), but I think you could give a deeper explanation of how the various components of the sentence work to form indirect speech in your examples. But overall, I think you did an extremely good job on encountering data that will contribute towards your project.

### Ben's Response
Thanks! I'll definitely take that in mind. I've added a introduction to the construction with examples to the repo
to help explain how it is formed.

### Tianyi's Feedback

- **What was done well:**
I think you did a good job processing the data.
Your code was very clean and easy to follow, and I found the bar plots to be very useful for understanding the distribution of the two constructions.

- **What could be improved:**
I think you could go into more detail about what exactly constitutes "indirect speech"; does it mean that only constructions involving words related to speech ("said", "reported", "told", "stated", etc.) will be considered?
Your project plan says that your project will include *some* complementizer phrases since the construction is the same in Latin, but is there some way in which you plan to differentiate the two?
If not, then stating as such would probably help clarify the goals of your project.
Also, how will the subjunctive mood ("It's best that he go soon", etc.) be differentiated, if at all?

- **One thing I learned:**
I hadn't known that the structure of complementizer phrases was something that had changed so drastically in Latin.
Is it known when the "quod" construction first arose in Latin texts?
I'd love to see more background info about this topic.

### Ben's Response
As I said above, I've added a new file to help go over the construction, its uses, etc.
I'll try to find some background information on the development of the different clause types,
since that would definitely flesh out the project.
Thank you for the feedback!

### Rohan's Notes:
- **One thing I liked:** I liked the neatness of your scripts! I had no trouble understanding what you were doing or what it meant, even though I don't speak Latin.

- **One thing that could be improved:** I would have actually liked to see a little more of your process as you were cleaning and organizing your data. As it was all in a separate python script, it wasn't terribly interactive, and there could have been more comments explaining each part.

- **One thing I learned:** Your dataset looks really interesting, and I thought the shift in how indirect speech was written could definitely be used in a larger linguistic analysis of Latin. I was also surprised at how much of your data used the accusative to form indirect phrases.

## Misha's Feedback

**One thing that was done well:** You have an excellent start to a really good/straightforward variationist analysis of indirect speech in Latin. Computational methods are great for this, you'll be able to find plenty of data and modeling should run pretty smoothly.

**One avenue for improvement or suggestion:** Have you thought about the features that are likely to predict the use of one form over another? Were these forms ever in competition, meaning there are predictable constraining features or are they in complementary distribution?

**One thing I learned:** There are multiple ways for expressing indirect speech in latin!

### Kinan's Feedback

- **What was done well:**
  - The citations at the progres plan is a good idea and now that I am going to be uisng spacy im gonna steal this from you <3 xoxo I also like the overview of the daat except the first code output cell kind of through me for a loop for a sec.

- **What could be improved:**
  - Your Read Me can have some descriptions of what each file means, I know we just moved on and got the requirements for progress report 3 so thats probably what you're going to be working on anyways. 

- **One thing I learned:**
  - Subordinatitng cojunctions are good bc they explain the lingusitic contexts of whats going on. quod - because

### Man Ho's Feedback

- **What was done well:**
  - Your Python code is really concise and clear. I liked that all the variables have logical, well-thought names and the naming convention is consistent across scripts.

- **What could be improved:**
  -  Perhaps I am relatively new to Python so I still need to get used to Python's syntax, but I also think you may want to add more comments in your code. I think good documentation not only helps readers to understand and reuse your code, it would also help you to maintain the code in the future (if you plan to; but it's still a good habit to document). For my own research project, almost half of my code is documentation because I know someone in my lab or our collaborators are going to use it or update the code.

- **One thing I learned:**
  -  I was not aware of the accusative + infinitive form of indirect speech. Your `oo_introduction.md` was really helpful! I think I should also include more background information in my own term project.
