### Alejandro's Notes
This is an extremely interesting research project. I am extremely impressed at the data (and very surprised that it's free) and I think you will do amazing with it. I also am surprised to learn just how varied childhood linguistic development research can get as I assumed it would mostly be geared towards only the psychological side of things. However, I am a bit confused about what exactly you will be doing in the project. If I understand correctly from reading your `project_plan.md`, the bulk of your project is analyzing the dataset itself and highlighting the tools that came along with it. Could you add specific research questions with this?

> Thanks, Alejandro! I, too, am not *exactly* sure what I will ultimately do with the project :) I'm still working through the UDS dataset and the toolkit that comes with it which is a large component of my project.

### Ben's Notes
I think this is a very interesting project; I had never heard of
these data sets before and they look to have a lot of information within them.
If I had one critique, it would be that due to the complex nature of the project,
I would add some description of what the UDS data set contains and how it can be used,
as I was initially a bit confused by it.

> Thanks, Ben! It took me a while initially to figure out what UDS was too, and I'm still figuring it out! There is a paper that goes along with it that I linked from my project plan file, but I should also write up a summary about the UDS dataset (or at least something about it) to go along with the other stuff in my repo. 

### Rohan's Notes:

- **One thing I liked:** Your project is fascinating! I really like the idea of taking two datasets that study different things and examining them through the context of the other one. I hope you get all your data figured out, I think the analysis should be fascinating!

- **One thing that could be improved:** Your initial exploration notebook was really interesting, but it sometimes felt like a little too much was being printed. There were several point where I had to scroll through pages on pages of data to get to the next analysis, so it could be a little cleaner.

- **One thing I learned:** The existence of the UDS and CHILDES datasets! The CHILDES one sounds particularly interesting, I'm really excited to see what you do with it.
