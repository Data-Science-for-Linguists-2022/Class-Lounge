### Alejandro's Notes
This is an extremely interesting research project. I am extremely impressed at the data (and very surprised that it's free) and I think you will do amazing with it. I also am surprised to learn just how varied childhood linguistic development research can get as I assumed it would mostly be geared towards only the psychological side of things. However, I am a bit confused about what exactly you will be doing in the project. If I understand correctly from reading your `project_plan.md`, the bulk of your project is analyzing the dataset itself and highlighting the tools that came along with it. Could you add specific research questions with this?
