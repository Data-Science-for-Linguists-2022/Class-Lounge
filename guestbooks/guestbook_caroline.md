### Alejandro's Notes
This is an extremely interesting research project. I am extremely impressed at the data (and very surprised that it's free) and I think you will do amazing with it. I also am surprised to learn just how varied childhood linguistic development research can get as I assumed it would mostly be geared towards only the psychological side of things. However, I am a bit confused about what exactly you will be doing in the project. If I understand correctly from reading your `project_plan.md`, the bulk of your project is analyzing the dataset itself and highlighting the tools that came along with it. Could you add specific research questions with this?

> Thanks, Alejandro! I, too, am not *exactly* sure what I will ultimately do with the project :) I'm still working through the UDS dataset and the toolkit that comes with it which is a large component of my project.

### Ben's Notes
I think this is a very interesting project; I had never heard of
these data sets before and they look to have a lot of information within them.
If I had one critique, it would be that due to the complex nature of the project,
I would add some description of what the UDS data set contains and how it can be used,
as I was initially a bit confused by it.

> Thanks, Ben! It took me a while initially to figure out what UDS was too, and I'm still figuring it out! There is a paper that goes along with it that I linked from my project plan file, but I should also write up a summary about the UDS dataset (or at least something about it) to go along with the other stuff in my repo.

### Rohan's Notes:

- **One thing I liked:** Your project is fascinating! I really like the idea of taking two datasets that study different things and examining them through the context of the other one. I hope you get all your data figured out, I think the analysis should be fascinating!

- **One thing that could be improved:** Your initial exploration notebook was really interesting, but it sometimes felt like a little too much was being printed. There were several point where I had to scroll through pages on pages of data to get to the next analysis, so it could be a little cleaner.

- **One thing I learned:** The existence of the UDS and CHILDES datasets! The CHILDES one sounds particularly interesting, I'm really excited to see what you do with it.

> Thanks for the feedback, Rohan! I also didn't know about the existence of either one of these datasets before I started this project!

### Tianyi's Notes:

- **One thing I liked:**
I really like the depth of your project plan.
You seem to have a good idea of the data exploration that you plan to do prior to starting your analysis, which is of course a very good thing.
Like others have said, it's very interesting that you're not only analyzing a dataset but specifically analyzing it within the context of another dataset.

- **One thing that could be improved:**
In `hicks_initial_exploration.ipynb`, I think it'd be best for you to leave out most of the printed data, as a small sample would suffice.
In `uds_initial_exploration.ipynb`, most of the Python code blocks were never run, so I'm not sure what the output is meant to be (I'm guessing it's due to the error in the first code block, though).

- **One thing I learned:** I think it's interesting that not only such datasets exist but also that the UDS organizes its data into a graphical format.

> Thank you, Tianyi! I started out with a decently solid plan, but it has been a struggle to do what I wanted to do with the UDS dataset because it is so massive and comes with its own toolkit. I have now fixed the thing that was causing the error in loading the dataset and toolkit!
