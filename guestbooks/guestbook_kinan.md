- **What was done well:** I really liked the organization of the README. This made it super easy to get acquainted with all the files (and the links made it easy to find them!). The jupyter notebook is also super organized, with links to each section!
- **What could be improved:** There are a few typos in analysis section of the project plan--these just make it look a little less professional. I think the jupyter notebook could also benefit from a little blurb at the beginning (of the file and each large section) explaining what the code does.
- **What I learned:** Looking at the three graphs, I'm surprised to see that Mandarin has such low values comparatively for sentence length, sentence tokens, and word tokens.  I suppose this makes sense, since Chinese orthography is group by syllable and the other five languages write in more phoneme-like segments.  I also learned that I need to get on reorganizing my repository because, *shucks*, this looks good!
