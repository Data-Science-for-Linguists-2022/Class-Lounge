# To-do 12: Poking at Big Data (Yelp)

## Na-Rae the fake student:
- My 4-year-old ThinkPad laptop did ok! It has ... RAM, which worked ok with this much data, etc. Grepping through the whole of xxx json file took...

## Kinan:
- My Macbook which I got when I thought I was going to be a polisci major is traumatized from switching to CS. Downloading it only took 10 minutes suprisingly. I believe a supercomputer or just a PC designed for processing data would do this a lot better, this todo was a lot of sitting and waiting for things to process. My computer sounded like a Spirit flight. I learned that patience is a virtue with big data and that if I want to continue working with large data sets (which I am doing for my term project) I need to start considering what computers I should purcahse beforehand.
